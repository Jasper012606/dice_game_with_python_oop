Players take turns deciding whether to roll a die. If a player chooses to roll and gets a number between 2 and 6, that number is added to their score. However, if they roll a 1, their score resets to 0. Players may also choose to skip their turn. The game continues in turns until one player reaches a score of 50 or more, winning the game.\n")
